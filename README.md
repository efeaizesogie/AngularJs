**AngularJS Project Setup**

This document provides instructions on how to set up and get started with an AngularJS project.

**Prerequisites**
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager): AngularJS requires Node.js and npm to manage dependencies and run scripts.

**Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up the AngularJS project:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-angularjs-project.git
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:
bash
Copy code
cd your-angularjs-project
npm install
Run the Application: After installing the dependencies, you can run the AngularJS application using a local development server. Run the following command:
bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Project Structure: The project follows a typical AngularJS project structure. The main application files can be found in the app folder. The index.html file serves as the entry point to the application, and the app.js file contains the AngularJS application module and configuration.

Development Workflow: While running the application using npm start, any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger a rebuild, and the browser will refresh to reflect the changes.

Testing: The project includes a sample testing setup using Karma and Jasmine. You can run tests using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Additional Notes
For production builds, you can use the npm run build command. This will create a production-ready build in the dist folder.

Explore the package.json file to understand the available scripts and dependencies.

Feel free to modify the project structure to suit your specific needs as the project evolves.
